First of all I want to tell that I will be using Foursquare location API to get location data easily
and convert it in an easy and understandable format.

_Foursquare is the most trusted, independent location data platform for understanding how people move 
through the real world._

**Dataset**

I have imported data of all the restaurants present in Mumbai using the Foursquare api.
Now I will cluster data according to locations and categories provided by the api.
This will provide me the relevant data of restaurants:
    **Locations where there are more number ofrestaurants**
    **Categories of restaurants which are common.**

I will use the API once as it will provide me with all the location of restaurants in Mumbai.
